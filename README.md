## Description

These Matlab files are simulate the agent-based model as described in
``Spatio-temporal modelling of human type 1 diabetes," Kyle C. A.
Wedgwood, Sarah J. Richardson, Noel G. Morgan and Krasimira
Tsaneva-Atanasova.

## Platform
The code has been developed for Matlab R2014b and tested on Matlab
R2016a and comes with no guarantee that it will work on earlier
releases.

## Running the code
Simply run the Driver.m script to start a simulation. Various
model-based parameters can be set in this file. Note that spatial
parameters have been scaled by a factor of 4 to increase code speed.
